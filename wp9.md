The 2015-2016 flag referenda were an exciting opportunity for New Zealand to revise and renew its face to the world.
However, New Zealand citizens were almost certainly right to reject the proposed design in favour of the current flag.
The proposal was hardly representative of New Zealand's people and cultures and did little to meet the government's proposed mission for the referenda.
Given the significant and nontrivial costs of adopting a new flag, settling for any design that is less than perfect would have been an irreparable mistake.

The New Zealand government's original motivations for the referenda were largely economical.
Their mission was to differentiate the flag from the Australian flag and demonstrate New Zealand's independence from Great Britain to help promote the nation's identity as a tourist destination.
However, these were superficial reasons to redesign the flag and, instead, the efforts to design a new flag should have been focused on accurately representing New Zealand's unique identity as a country and a people.
A flag that does this well would very likely be distinct from the Australian and British flags.

Today, New Zealand is the former colony with the best modern-day integration of its native people, cultures, and flora and fauna.
One of the finest examples of this is the designation and usage of Māori as an official language.
Thus, we should expect the flag of New Zealand to uphold this sample principle of integration.
The current flag, which consists of the Union Jack (a symbol of the British Empire) and the Southern Cross, represents little of New Zealand's native culture or peoples.
Although the Southern Cross constellation has significance in Māori culture, it is not an especially prominent symbol of Aotearoa.
The shortlisted design incorporates a silver fern (a sports symbol) alongside the Southern Cross, but still takes its colours and design heavily from the current flag.
Kiwi's dissatisfaction with this flag is evident in their proposal of the alternate Red Peak design that makes several references to traditional Māori colours, designs, and stories (Hunt 2015).
Also of note is that the choice of colours and preservation of the Southern Cross also did not support the original, superficial mission of distinguishing New Zealand from Australia and Great Britain.
Unfortunately little of New Zealand's native culture or people had found its way into the shortlisted design, a fatal flaw.

Especially jarring is that the majority of nations alongside New Zealand in the Commonwealth realm, all reigned by Queen Elizabeth II, have flags that do not feature a Union Jack or even its colours.
In fact, several of these nations, such as Canada, have successfully replaced Union Jack flags with new, original designs without disrupting their membership in the Commonwealth.
Given that history shows that the consequences of removing the Union Jack and its colours are effectively non-existent, this leaves little reason to continue to incorporate elements from the current New Zealand flag if they speak little to the country's unique identity.

If the shortlisted design had been accepted, it would have replaced the current flag at a prohibitive cost.
Given all of the uses of the New Zealand flag, in particular on personal identification, adopting a new design would cost on the order of millions of dollars.
It is this expense that makes any change effectively permanent by denying the possibility of any other designs being considered in the near future, if at all.

The shortlisted flag was without doubt unsuitable for the task of representing New Zealand's identity and furthermore was inappropriate even for the government's original, superficial mission of the referenda.
In addition, the non-trivial costs of changing the flag made this a long-standing and permanent decision.
Therefore, Kiwis are justified in their decision to keep the current flag in latest and future referenda until the New Zealand government is ready to consider a truly new and innovative flag that faithfully represents the country, its culture, and its history.
